<h1>Full HTML Page Support</h1>
<br/>
Full HTML pages can be included into kwiki, but only the contents of the &lt;body&gt; tag will be included.<br/>
Any enabled kwiki functionality like the left nav bar will still be processed.<br/>
This allows any html editors that require full, valid html pages to be used for creating and maintaining documentation.<br/>
