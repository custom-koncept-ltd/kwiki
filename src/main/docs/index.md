KWiki
=====

Documentation at its source...



Modern Developers have a lot of tools at their disposal when it comes to documentation, 
and the understanding and use of code.

We have:
* Source code and developer comments
* Javadoc for API documentation

and then I'm stuck editing some wiki or live-editable site for user documentation, 
as though it has no relationship to the code.

Or... you could you KWiki.

Plaintext wiki files that are trivial to check into source control, a simple way to view the resulting html, 
and an easy way to package the docs in an artifact friendly manner.
