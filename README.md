Kwiki
=====

Provides a HTML view for wiki style documentation.

Kwiki supports the mediawiki and markdown syntaxes (and html) as its source, and renders them to HTML.
The generated docs can either be viewed live from the bundled server, or included with the maven artifacts of the project.

see [here](src/main/docs/) for the main docs
